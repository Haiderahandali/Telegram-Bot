The main aim for this project was to help professors and students to easily convert their files.

PR are welcomed.

### **TODO**
### 1 - Make a Queue system, to deal with large number of requests.
### 2 - Make the convert specific pages instead of all
### 3 - convert multiple files into a single pdf
### 4 - accept images as images and not pictures
### 5 - add more comamnds to make it more robust
